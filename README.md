# Puppet Test

Investigating configuring an Ubuntu Linux server using Puppet. 


- .tf files for Puppet master: `puppet_master.tf`, `puppet_master_variables.tf`.
- .tf files for Puppet agent node: [here](https://github.com/nick-otter/terraform-azure-virtual-machine[]).

## Notes on Process

As I haven't used Puppet before, I have highlighted parts of the process to use Puppet that are interesting or differ from Ansible.
